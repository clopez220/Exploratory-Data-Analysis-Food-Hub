Project Overview:

Context:
As the restaurant industry in New York continues to expand, the demand for convenient food delivery services has surged, especially among students and busy professionals. FoodHub, a leading food aggregator company, offers a solution by providing access to a variety of restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The FoodHub app facilitates direct online ordering from restaurants, assigning a delivery person to pick up and deliver orders to customers. Upon confirmation, the delivery person navigates to the restaurant, picks up the order, and transports it to the customer's location. Customers can rate their orders within the app, while FoodHub earns revenue by charging a fixed margin on delivery orders.

Objective:
In this project, we aim to analyze the data stored by FoodHub regarding customer orders. As a Data Scientist hired by the company, our goal is to gain insights that will enhance customer experience and drive business improvement. The Data Science team has outlined key questions that require answers to inform decision-making and strategy development.

Data Description:
The dataset contains various attributes related to food orders, each providing valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. The data dictionary includes:

* order_id: Unique identifier for each order
* customer_id: Identifier for the customer who placed the order
* restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant fulfilling the order
* cuisine_type: Type of cuisine ordered by the customer
* cost: Cost of the order
* day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order was placed on a weekday or weekend
* rating: Customer rating of the order (out of 5)
* food_preparation_time: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the food (in minutes)
* delivery_time: Time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package (in minutes)
By leveraging this data, we aim to address critical business questions and provide actionable insights for FoodHub's continued success and growth.
